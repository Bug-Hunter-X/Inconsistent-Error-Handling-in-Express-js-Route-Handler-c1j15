# Express.js Error Handling Bug

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications: inconsistent and incomplete error handling in route handlers.

The `bug.js` file contains an Express.js route handler that fetches user data from a database.  It lacks proper error handling for several scenarios:

1. **Database Errors:**  The code doesn't handle potential database errors effectively, resulting in a generic 'Internal Server Error' response, which doesn't provide enough information for debugging.
2. **Non-Existent User IDs:**  If a user with the specified ID doesn't exist, there's no appropriate response.  A 404 (Not Found) response would be more suitable.

The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version with improved error handling.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `node bug.js`.
3. Send requests to `/users/:id` with various IDs.

Observe the responses and compare them to the expected behavior in `bugSolution.js`.
